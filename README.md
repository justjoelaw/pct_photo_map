# Trail Journal App

**A journal app designed for hikers**
- Place journal entries on a map of the hiking trail
- Full admin screen

This app was built to give me experience in two technologies I had not used before:
- Express
- Redux

The app utilises the following technologies:
- Express - backend
- React - frontend
- Redux Toolkit - state management
- Leaflet - interactive maps

## Usage
Add and view journal entries on a map of your hiking trail:
